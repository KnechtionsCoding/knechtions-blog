## Why This Post

This post doesn't endeavor to teach you all that you need to know in order to become a DevOps engineer, nor does it seek to deep dive into any specific areas. Its purpose is instead to teach you the areas in tech that are useful, and specifically how to go from a System Administrator to a DevOps Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer.

### What is DevOps

Much like the Emacs, Vim, Vi, Nano wars or the Arch vs everyone else wars there are wars online about the definition of DevOps every single day. If you ask 10 tech engineers what DevOps is, you'll get 11 different opinions.

In my experience however DevOps encompasses two technical tasks:

1. Developing and maintaining CI\CD Pipelines for Developers/Businesses
2. Managing underlying infrastructure in an Automated Manner.

These two things are relatively easy compared to the non-technical part, however.

The most important, and hardest, part of DevOps Engineering/SRE is changing/maintaining culture. DevOps isn't a series of tools one can throw at a problem and have it magically be solved. It will not magically improve up-time or code quality. It will not magically deliver more features to your application or site. 

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
